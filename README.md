# upm-packages
A set of common packages used in my personal Unity projects, to ease package management of other UPM packages and ensure no duplication of dependencies. These are primarily meant for personal use. If you want to use these as well, I would recommend forking this repository, as I might (accidently) break this repository.

## Current packages

Each relevant package is stored on a separate branch of this repository. Each upm branch is prefixed with `upm/`.
The following table shows the current packages stored within repository.

| Package name                                                    | Description                                                                                                                    | Branch name       |
